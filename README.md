# Hi, I'm Larry - Creator of GoTi 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

I'm a full stack web engineer based in Atlanta.  Currently, I am working on an open source social networking app that targeted to be performant, minimal, and easy to host.  Some technologies I enjoy working with include React, Astro, Typescript, Python, Go, and C#.  I also do enjoy getting punished by Rust and it's borrow checker from time to time.  =)
