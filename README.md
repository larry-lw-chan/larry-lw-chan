# Hi, I'm Larry - Creator of GoTi 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

I'm a full stack web engineer based in Atlanta.  Currently, I am working on an open source social networking app that targeted to be performant, minimal, and easy to host.

Some technologies I enjoy working with include: 
React, Astro (Jamstack), Typescript, Python, Go, and C#.  

I also do enjoy getting punished by Rust and it's borrow checker from time to time.  =)

## Find me around the web 🌎:
