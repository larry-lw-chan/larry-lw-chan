# Hi, I'm Larry - Creator of GoTi 😃

I'm a full stack web engineer based in Atlanta.  Currently, I am working on GoTi, an open source social networking app that targeted to be performant, minimal, and easy to host.

The tech stack I use include: 
React, Astro (Jamstack), Typescript, Python, Go, and C#.  

Frameworks I've used in the past includes:
Ruby on Rails, Django

I also do enjoy getting punished by Rust and it's borrow checker from time to time.  =)
