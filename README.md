# Hi, I'm Larry - Creator of GoTi 😃

I'm a full stack web engineer based in Atlanta.  Currently, I am working on GoTi, a compiled, easy to run social networking app that targeted to be performant, minimal, and easy to host.

The tech stack I generally use include: 
React, Astro (Jamstack), Typescript, Python, and Go.  Also certified in C# and Java.

Web Frameworks I've used in the past also includes:
Django, Ruby on Rails, Wordpress, and Drupal

Recently been studying Machine Learning and now I'm a Google Certified Tensorflow Developer

I also do enjoy getting punished by Rust and it's borrow checker from time to time.  =)
